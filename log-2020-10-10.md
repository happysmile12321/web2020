This is what I start to learn web.

I am a vimer.

## why I chose web

Couple of years,I try to scratch what I can do in the computer world.

I try to understand API,OS,DB,Soft Enginer,network,Programing Lauguange,IDE,and so on.

And I find a little upset.I am so late to come to this world,there are so many concept be came out,I even can't do a little change.But I can join them,eh?

So I chose a Lauguange,Java. So upset to me, I can't stand it anymore.The reason for many.

But I have to saw,Java gave me the most than any others.I am so quickly to meet vim,then neovim and love it,the speed is what Java gave me.It taught me a way to learn , a way to thinking Programing Lauguange itself.

And as time goes by,the most use java,the most find it control your data,to send front end,and that's all.

So ,the backend is just handle data,isn't it?

Frankly Speeking,I do not like data,math,any with the numbers,it coulnd be related with my experience with math,but what anyway,I just don't like it.

Frankly Speeking for two,I am in China.I can't access to web freely,so there are some people who scratch resource and make to document,class to sell China's programer.That really sucks.So I came to know so many so many,is very hard,hard,and hard.Also my mother Lauguange isn't English.That is diffecult for the one who want to learn programming.

And be Frankly see,it is easy for foreginer to build a tool(what ever)to control CPU,memory,GPU,...If you can do this,you can just write another C programming Lauguange,that is not a big deal.

That not fair,a lot of things not fair,but you have to accept it.

But there are some amazing guy to guild some other people to attach their goals,these people I will keep in mind.

One of them told me that the whole world is just a encode and decode system.

So,web is also.

Before came to web,I learned little Goland,and study a little ui framework--gocui.

And I found some interesting that I never can't find with Java.

It is RGB,right,RGB.

I heard a lot of time,but can't to understand completely,and when I watch gocui's code,I get out of that.

RGB--(world color)--(encode)--(computer)--(decode)-(perhaps terminal,browser).

That's it,not so difficult,it's just need,so it come out.

GoCUI(termbox)MODE.8(8 different colors)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
_,_,_(3 bit)

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
0 -- black
1 -- red
2 -- green
3 -- yellow
4 -- blue
5 -- ...
6 -- ...
7 -- white


GoCUI(termbox)MODE.256(256 different colors)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
r r r g g g b b
_,_,_,_,_,_,_,_(8 bit)

r r g g g b b b
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

term sucks,that another important word that I heard.Why I can't just use modern rgb's decode system(browser),
the people who developed obviewsly want to see some other use their's product.So Why I can't just write a little
css to display some view but try to find a hard code to represent a color,and so on....The Former is easier,right?

So back to rgb in browser,rgb stands 24bit length,but computer is more like 8,16,32.So we gave it more 8 bit,which caled argb.It is just added transparent.That's not big deal,and browser perhaps not to mention the last 8 bit,but they very care the 1,2,3 's word (8 bit|8 bit 8 bit).

Well,then r have ox 00 ~ ox ff =>[0,255],so as g and b.

well done,that's rgb,isn't very hard.

So,why I can't study that?I liked just like vim,why keep it.How many times do we have in our lifes?
## Why I chose neovim as my editor

a screen,a keyboard,a powerfull CPU,a large memory,a fast disk,a plenty fullcharge,a quiet cpu runing perhaps is all who like code wantted.I want to.Now I have a big screen,a fast enough OS,a completely keyboard coding,and every things are done.I feel well.I am a newer in vim,but perhaps I will use it all my rest life.So that a big question?

I still want to recoment my tool chain.It is based on the community of suckless.org,which I think very nice,all my tools now in xwindows, is supported by them,really thanks them.

I chose vim because I can type with out touch mouse,isn't that rediculous? Just because that,I gave up Java.Because vim support sucks on Java,(which because I used the Intellija idea,enven eclipse are better then vim to coding Java).

Key input,and that result can came out,that's what I want to see happended.Luckiy ,neovim can provider that feature.You just mapping everything,vim will talk to your system to handle some things for you.And that's wonderful!!!

## Before to enter web,what I studied

I am a guy who like computer,So I learned a lot of little tools , worderfull skills to handle many many many problems.

But there is still what I think the most worthful to play:
- Linux Shell
		* I just read that bash shell,Oh my lady,it is not easy to read,but reback are also more.
- Arch Linux
		* pacman
				+ Install Any Popular tools       
		* arch wiki.
				+ Linux Knowledge library,developed by global world.I liked it.it's liked a family.
- Go
		* Go is clean.clean.clean.
		* Go is like C++'s style,and Java's style,could be a powerfull language for build backend in the future.
		* Go is supportted by Google.
		* Go let you write code just like taste a cup of tee.
- git
		* Powerfull version control system for lots of people together work.Which I am using now is using git.
- Bigdata?
		* I am not sure,that this will helpful.But I trully get some from this.
# How to start

1. create a time table,and do it with time limites.
2. create git branch on github,which can manager my code,if the future I will use it.
3. using a the resource that I can access
4. if no tool for me,that write it in Go.
