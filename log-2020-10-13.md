Today is a normal day.
Which I think it should be normal as usual day.
But when I want to sleep,I want to view a plug's writer's zhihu.
I found a man who is very smart and do a lot of job backend and efficiently.
I rethinked openSource.
1.openSource's quality cannot be stable.
2.the develeper also do it not just for interest.
3.Only you really write soft which is a tool that people can everyday use it,then you can really grow up,what ever you came from.
4.Tool software code can talk the ability behind the code's man.
which I think,I only commit 6 times,a lot of them is still cannot understand.Is the word I don't recognised?No,each word I recg,but not for a line.So it must be the code's mind behind that did worked me.How?Like RGB,I can try to get a source code to understand what it means,when I cannot understand the document.I should more scratch the document but not for the video,because even me,as a video content provider,know making video is timecost,and perhaps no reback.So,still document does well.Also,I should like my vim.Because it will support me to writting these code.--which I don't like to write this code in an IDE or vscode's text editor.If I have some mind,I should start.Start that programe by making a repository.And making a todo list.Do some real work,do some hard study.Do really worked programe.Perhaps I will thought for a night.The whool project I think should be done with Go.Which is clean.(important).
